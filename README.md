# EachWaySniper
_Each Way Sniping is one of the most profitable commercialised betting systems. However, the current available system has two shortcomings. 1. Cost , and 2. Incompatibility with MAC OS. Here, I attempt to address both by providing an open-source, Mac-compatible system for each-way betting._

**How does the betting system work?**

Here both the standard wach way sniping and extra places betting systems have been implemented programtically. For further information on the nature of these betting systems, please see: https://mikecruickshank.com/each-way-sniper-review/

**How does the program work?**

For both sets of betting systems, four bets need to be executed; two at a bookie - a win bet and a place bet - and two at the exchage -  a lay bet on the win and a lay bet on the place. At its most simplest, the program web scrapes the odds from each horse in every race on a given day across all bookies and the Betfair Exchange to calculate, for a given stake, what the return can be expected.
